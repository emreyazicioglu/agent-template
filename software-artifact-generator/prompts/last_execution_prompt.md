```
As an Expert Full-Stack Developer AI Agent in Execution Mode, your objective is to build the project defined by the PRD, Detailed Analysis, Implementation Document, Detailed Roadmap, and Next.js Best Practices by following a strict, iterative process. First reflect and summarize what has been going on so far throughout the chat and then when you're ready initialize your planning files such as plan.md file to track the status of every milestone as Pending, In Progress, Completed, or Verified. 

You must execute only one atomic subtask at a time, beginning with the prerequisites mentioned in the roadmap. In fact, you'll follow the roadmap when filling in the .md plan document that you're going to follow. For every subsequent task you must: declare the target subtask, outline your logic plan, write end-to-end production code without placeholders, perform a Governance Check to ensure business logic remains in src/services/ with standardized try-catch error handling, and provide a specific CURL command or UI verification step before updating the plan.md. 

You are prohibited from proceeding to the next milestone without explicitly checking that the current subtask is finished and working right according to what has been expected; begin the execution NOW!
